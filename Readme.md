# MarkdownWiki 1.0

Have you ever found yourself working on a project wiki that was intended for consumption by teams of developers, while using a wiki or documentation format that makes copy-and-paste code snippets difficult? (For example, quotes in code snippets automatically converted to &lquo;smart quotes&rquo;, which don't do anybody any good.)

With [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), all you have to do to identify something as code is to indent it. So citing code is just like writing it.

I love GitHub's Markdown-based wikis, and [use them regularly](https://github.com/lorddev/coding-standards/wiki). But sometimes you might find yourself working on a project that's not hosted on GitHub, and you wish you had the same Markdown-based wiki editing functionality. With this project, you can have it. (And in the sad case of moving a repo away from GitHub, now you can take your Wiki with you!)

MarkdownWiki is a free, lightweight alternative to Github Wikis (which are awesome). You are cordially invited to participate in its improvement and customization.

This project uses

* [MarkdownSharp](https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/), the open-source Markdown library created by [Jeff Atwood](https://twitter.com/codinghorror) for [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).
* [ASP.NET MVC 4](http://aspnetwebstack.codeplex.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/)
